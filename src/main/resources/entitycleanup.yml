# LagXpert - Entity Cleanup Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file configures the automatic entity cleanup task that removes
# problematic entities to improve server performance.
#
# IMPORTANT: The entire Entity Cleanup module must first be enabled via
# 'modules.entity-cleanup: true' in the main 'config.yml'.
# Settings in this file only apply if that master module toggle is active.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

entity-cleanup:
  # Interval (in server ticks) between each automatic cleanup run.
  # 1 second = 20 ticks. For example, 6000 ticks = 5 minutes.
  # WARNING: Setting this value too low (e.g., below 1200 ticks / 1 minute)
  # can potentially impact server performance, especially on busy servers.
  interval-ticks: 6000

  # Initial delay (in server ticks) before the first automatic cleanup run
  # occurs after the server starts or the plugin is enabled/reloaded.
  initial-delay-ticks: 6000

  # Specify which worlds the entity cleanup should operate in.
  # - To enable for all worlds, add "all" (lowercase) to the list.
  # - To specify particular worlds, list their names exactly.
  # Example for specific worlds:
  # enabled-worlds:
  #   - "world"
  #   - "world_nether"
  # Example for all worlds:
  # enabled-worlds:
  #   - "all"
  enabled-worlds:
    - "world"
    - "world_nether"
    - "world_the_end"
    # - "all" # Uncomment and remove specific worlds above to enable for all worlds.
