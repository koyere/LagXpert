# LagXpert - Redstone Control Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configures the behavior of the redstone control system.
# This system aims to prevent lag caused by redstone mechanisms that remain
# active for excessively long periods or update too rapidly (future consideration).
#
# IMPORTANT: The entire redstone control module must first be enabled via
# 'modules.redstone: true' in the main 'config.yml'.
# Settings in this file only apply if that master module toggle is active.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

control:
  # Maximum duration (in server ticks) that a redstone wire (Material.REDSTONE_WIRE)
  # may remain continuously powered before LagXpert intervenes (e.g., by cutting the wire).
  # 1 second = 20 ticks. Default: 100 ticks = 5 seconds.
  # Set to 0 or a negative value to disable this specific duration check,
  # though RedstoneListener's scheduleRedstoneCheck already handles delayTicks <= 0.
  redstone-active-ticks: 100

  # Future considerations for this file (not yet implemented in current code):
  # - Whitelisted redstone components (e.g., allow specific clocks).
  # - Different tick limits for different redstone components (e.g., pistons, comparators).
  # - Control over rapid pulsing/clock detection.
