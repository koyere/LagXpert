# LagXpert - Smart Chunk Management Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file configures the intelligent chunk management system that optimizes
# chunk loading and unloading to improve server performance.
#
# IMPORTANT: The entire Smart Chunk Management module must first be enabled via
# 'modules.chunk-management: true' in the main 'config.yml'.
# Settings in this file only apply if that master module toggle is active.
