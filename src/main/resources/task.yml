# LagXpert - Scheduled Tasks Configuration

# ‚è± Controls how frequently the AutoChunkScanTask checks loaded chunks to detect overloads.
# The interval is in server ticks (20 ticks = 1 second).
#
# IMPORTANT: This task will only run if the 'auto-chunk-scan' module is enabled
# in the main 'config.yml' file (modules.auto-chunk-scan: true).

task:
  # Delay in ticks between each automatic scan of loaded chunks near players.
  # Default: 600 ticks = 30 seconds.
  # Setting this too low on very large servers with many players could potentially
  # increase server load, although the task itself has been optimized.
