# LagXpert - Fine-Grained Alert Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file allows you to control which specific types of alerts are active.
# These settings only take effect if the main 'alerts' module is enabled
# in 'config.yml' (under 'modules.alerts: true').
#
# All actual message text for these alerts should be configured in 'messages.yml'.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Settings for alerts triggered when a hard limit is reached (e.g., by listeners on block placement or entity spawn).
# These also apply if AutoChunkScanTask is configured to show specific limit alerts.
show-limit-reached-alerts:
  mobs: true
  hoppers: true
  chests: true           # Covers both regular and trapped chests
  furnaces: true         # Covers regular furnaces, blast furnaces, and smokers if they share a limit conceptually
  blast_furnaces: true   # Or specific toggle if different from general furnaces
  smokers: true          # Or specific toggle
  barrels: true
  droppers: true
  dispensers: true
  shulker_boxes: true    # Covers all shulker box types
  tnt: true
  pistons: true          # Covers both regular and sticky pistons
  observers: true
  redstone: true         # For alerts from RedstoneListener actions

# Settings for "near limit" warning alerts (e.g., when a chunk reaches 80% of a configured limit).
# These apply to listeners and potentially to the AutoChunkScanTask.
show-near-limit-warnings:
  mobs: true
  hoppers: true
  chests: true
  furnaces: true
  blast_furnaces: true
  smokers: true
  barrels: true
  droppers: true
  dispensers: true
  shulker_boxes: true
  tnt: true
  pistons: true
  observers: true
  # Note: Redstone typically doesn't have a "near limit" warning in the same way,
  # as it's more about prolonged activity.

# Settings specific to alerts generated by the AutoChunkScanTask.
auto-chunk-scan-alerts:
  # If true, a summary message will be broadcast to players in an overloaded chunk
  # detailing all elements that exceeded their limits during a scan.
  # (Message template for this is in messages.yml, e.g., 'alerts.chunk-scan.overloaded-summary')
  send-overload-summary: true

  # If true, the auto-scan will also trigger individual "near-limit" warnings
  # for elements it finds near their threshold. This uses the 'show-near-limit-warnings'
  # settings above to determine which specific near-limit warnings are active.
  trigger-individual-near-limit-warnings: true

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Alert Cooldown System
# Prevents spamming players with the same alert repeatedly in a short time.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
alert-cooldown:
  # Default cooldown duration in seconds. An alert of the same type for the same
  # specific condition (e.g., same limit in the same chunk for the same player)
  # will not be re-sent to that player until this many seconds have passed.
  # Set to 0 to disable alert cooldowns.
