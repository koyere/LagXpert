# üß† Debug Mode
# If true, LagXpert will output additional information to the server console,
# which can be helpful for diagnosing issues or understanding plugin behavior.
# It's recommended to keep this false during normal operation.
# When enabled, shows detailed cache statistics, async processing info, and circuit tracking data.
debug: false

# üöÄ Performance Settings (Phase 1 Optimizations)
# These settings control the new performance optimization features introduced in Phase 1.
