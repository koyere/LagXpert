# LagXpert - Performance Monitoring Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file configures the TPS monitoring system and performance tracking features.
# Provides real-time server performance analysis, automatic lag detection,
# and comprehensive performance history storage.
#
# IMPORTANT: The entire monitoring module must first be enabled via
# 'modules.monitoring: true' in the main 'config.yml'.
# Settings in this file only apply if that master module toggle is active.

monitoring:
  # TPS (Ticks Per Second) monitoring configuration
  tps:
    # Enable/disable TPS monitoring system
    enabled: true

    # Update interval for TPS calculations (in server ticks)
    # Lower values provide more accurate real-time data but use more resources
    # 1 second = 20 ticks. Recommended: 20-100 ticks
    update-interval-ticks: 20

    # TPS calculation windows (in seconds)
    # These determine how TPS averages are calculated over different time periods
    calculation-windows:
      short-term: 60    # 1 minute average
      medium-term: 300  # 5 minutes average
      long-term: 900    # 15 minutes average

    # Performance thresholds for automatic alerts

  # Lag spike detection
  lag-detection:
    # Enable/disable automatic lag spike detection
    enabled: true

    # Tick time threshold for lag spike detection (in milliseconds)
    # Server tick should ideally be 50ms (20 TPS), anything above threshold is a lag spike
