# LagXpert - Storage and Block Limits Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file defines the maximum number of certain storage-related or
# potentially lag-intensive blocks allowed per chunk.
#
# When these limits are exceeded during block placement (by StorageListener)
# or detected by a chunk scan (by AutoChunkScanTask), warnings may be issued
# or actions may be taken, based on plugin configuration and permissions.
#
# IMPORTANT: The entire storage limiting module must first be enabled via
# 'modules.storage: true' in the main 'config.yml'.
# Settings in this file only apply if that master module toggle is active.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

limits:
  # Standard Storage Blocks
  chests-per-chunk: 20             # Limit for regular Chests and Trapped Chests combined.
  hoppers-per-chunk: 8             # Limit for Hoppers.
  furnaces-per-chunk: 10           # Limit for standard Furnaces.
  blast_furnaces-per-chunk: 6      # Limit for Blast Furnaces.
  smokers-per-chunk: 6             # Limit for Smokers. (Ensure ConfigManager loads this)
  barrels-per-chunk: 10            # Limit for Barrels.
  shulker_boxes-per-chunk: 5       # Limit for all types of Shulker Boxes.

  # Redstone Components & Other Utility Blocks
  droppers-per-chunk: 10           # Limit for Droppers.
  dispensers-per-chunk: 10         # Limit for Dispensers.
  observers-per-chunk: 10          # Limit for Observers.
  pistons-per-chunk: 12            # Limit for Pistons (both regular and sticky).
  tnt-per-chunk: 6                 # Limit for TNT blocks.

    # Entities (Optional - Current implementation might not check this on block placement)
    # hopper_minecarts-per-chunk: 4    # Limit for Hopper Minecarts (entities).
    # Note: Limiting entities like minecarts per chunk would typically be
    # handled by EntityListener or AutoChunkScanTask, not StorageListener (which is for blocks).
    # This key is not actively used by ConfigManager in the last reviewed version.
  # Implementation for this limit would need to be added to the Java code.
