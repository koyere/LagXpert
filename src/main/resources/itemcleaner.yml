# LagXpert - Item Cleaner and Abyss System Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file configures the automatic ground item clearing task and the Abyss
# item recovery system.
#
# IMPORTANT: The entire Item Cleaner module (which includes the Abyss system)
# must first be enabled via 'modules.item-cleaner: true' in the main 'config.yml'.
# Settings in this file only apply if that master module toggle is active.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

item-cleaner:
  # Settings for the automatic ground item clearing task.

  # Interval (in server ticks) between each automatic cleanup run.
  # 1 second = 20 ticks. For example, 6000 ticks = 5 minutes.
  # WARNING: Setting this value too low (e.g., below 600 ticks / 30 seconds)
  # can potentially impact server performance, especially on busy servers.
  interval-ticks: 6000

  # Initial delay (in server ticks) before the first automatic cleanup run
  # occurs after the server starts or the plugin is enabled/reloaded.
  # If not specified, it often defaults to 'interval-ticks'.
  initial-delay-ticks: 6000

  # Specify which worlds the automatic item cleaner should operate in.
  # - To enable for all worlds, add "all" (lowercase) to the list.
  # - To specify particular worlds, list their names exactly.
  # Example for specific worlds:
  # enabled-worlds:
  #   - "world"
  #   - "world_nether"
  # Example for all worlds:
  # enabled-worlds:
  #   - "all"
  enabled-worlds:
    - "world"
    - "world_nether"
    - "world_the_end"
    # - "all" # Uncomment and remove specific worlds above to enable for all worlds.

  # List of item material names (from Bukkit's Material enum, e.g., DIAMOND_SWORD)
  # that should be EXCLUDED from automatic removal. These items will be ignored by the cleaner.
  # Comparisons are case-insensitive.
  # Example:
  # excluded-items:
  #   - "DIAMOND_PICKAXE"
  #   - "NETHERITE_SWORD"
  excluded-items: []

  warning:
    # Enable or disable the broadcast warning message before items are automatically cleared.
    enabled: true

    # How many seconds before the actual cleanup the warning message should be broadcast.
    time-seconds: 10

  messages:
    # Message broadcast to all players to warn about impending item cleanup.
    # Placeholder: {seconds} - will be replaced with the value from 'time-seconds' above.
    warning: "&e[LagXpert] &7Ground items will be cleared in &c{seconds}&7 seconds!"

    # Message broadcast after items have been automatically cleared by the task.
    # Placeholder: {count} - will be replaced with the number of items cleared.
    cleaned: "&a[LagXpert] &fCleared &e{count}&f ground item(s)."

# Abyss Item Recovery System
# Allows players to recover items that were cleared by the ItemCleanerTask or
# through manual /clearitems commands, for a limited duration.
abyss:
  # Enable or disable the Abyss system.
  # Note: The Abyss system will only function if this is true AND the main
  # 'item-cleaner' module (in config.yml) is also enabled.
  enabled: true

  # Duration (in seconds) for which cleared items are kept in the abyss
  # before being permanently deleted and becoming unrecoverable.
  retention-seconds: 120

  # Maximum number of individual item stacks that can be stored in the abyss per player.
  # When this limit is reached for a player, the oldest items in their abyss
  # are removed to make space for newly cleared items.
  max-items-per-player: 30

  messages:
    # Message sent to a player when they successfully recover items from their abyss.
    # Placeholder: {count} - number of item stacks recovered.
    recover: "&aYou recovered &f{count} &aitem(s) from the abyss."

    # Message sent to a player if their abyss is empty or all stored items have expired.
    empty: "&7You have no items to recover from the abyss."

    # Message sent to a player if item recovery was only partial because their inventory was full.
    # Some items might have been dropped on the ground in this case.
    recover-fail-full-inv: "&cYour inventory was full! Some recovered items may have been dropped on the ground."
