# LagXpert - Item Cleaner and Abyss System Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file configures the automatic ground item clearing task and the Abyss
# item recovery system.
#
# IMPORTANT: The entire Item Cleaner module (which includes the Abyss system)
# must first be enabled via 'modules.item-cleaner: true' in the main 'config.yml'.
# Settings in this file only apply if that master module toggle is active.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

item-cleaner:
  # Settings for the automatic ground item clearing task.

  # Interval (in server ticks) between each automatic cleanup run.
  # 1 second = 20 ticks. For example, 6000 ticks = 5 minutes.
  # WARNING: Setting this value too low (e.g., below 600 ticks / 30 seconds)
  # can potentially impact server performance, especially on busy servers.
  interval-ticks: 6000

  # Initial delay (in server ticks) before the first automatic cleanup run
  # occurs after the server starts or the plugin is enabled/reloaded.
  # If not specified, it often defaults to 'interval-ticks'.
  initial-delay-ticks: 6000

  # Specify which worlds the automatic item cleaner should operate in.
  # - To enable for all worlds, add "all" (lowercase) to the list.
  # - To specify particular worlds, list their names exactly.
  # Example for specific worlds:
  # enabled-worlds:
  #   - "world"
  #   - "world_nether"
  # Example for all worlds:
  # enabled-worlds:
  #   - "all"
  enabled-worlds:
    - "world"
    - "world_nether"
    - "world_the_end"
    # - "all" # Uncomment and remove specific worlds above to enable for all worlds.

  # List of item material names (from Bukkit's Material enum, e.g., DIAMOND_SWORD)
  # that should be EXCLUDED from automatic removal. These items will be ignored by the cleaner.
  # Comparisons are case-insensitive.
  # Example:
  # excluded-items:
  #   - "DIAMOND_PICKAXE"
  #   - "NETHERITE_SWORD"
  excluded-items: []
  
  # Enhanced broken block tracking settings
  # This system tracks when players break blocks and provides a grace period
  # during which dropped items from those blocks won't be cleaned up
  broken-block-tracking:
    # Enable/disable the broken block tracking system
    enabled: true
    
    # Default grace period (in seconds) for items from broken blocks
    # Items dropped from recently broken blocks won't be cleaned for this duration
    default-grace-period-seconds: 180  # 3 minutes
    
    # Custom grace periods for specific valuable materials (in seconds)
    # These override the default grace period for specific block types
    custom-grace-periods:
      # Extremely valuable blocks get extended grace periods
      DIAMOND_ORE: 300          # 5 minutes
      EMERALD_ORE: 300
      ANCIENT_DEBRIS: 300
      
      # Valuable ores get medium grace periods
      GOLD_ORE: 240            # 4 minutes
      IRON_ORE: 240
      COAL_ORE: 240
      
      # Storage blocks get very long grace periods (players need time to sort)
      CHEST: 600               # 10 minutes
      TRAPPED_CHEST: 600
      BARREL: 600
      
      # Spawners get maximum grace period (extremely rare and valuable)
      SPAWNER: 900             # 15 minutes

# Abyss Item Recovery System
# Allows players to recover items that were cleared by the ItemCleanerTask or
# through manual /clearitems commands, for a limited duration.
